D&amp;D Initiative Tracker for 5E (2024)
Quality of Life:

Duplicate button (⧉) — clones a creature with auto-numbering (e.g., "Goblin 1" → "Goblin 2")
Drag-to-reorder — grab the ⠿ handle on any creature row and drag to manually set turn order for tiebreakers or custom ordering

Combat Enhancements:

Concentration auto-tracking — when you deal damage to a creature with the Concentrating condition, a toast notification pops up with the exact DC for the CON save
Round-based timers (⏱) — add named effects with round durations to any creature; they auto-decrement at end of turn and log when they expire
Legendary action tracker — set a creature's legendary action count when adding them; shows as fillable dots that reset at the start of their turn
Lair actions — toggle via the ⚙ settings button; inserts a "Lair Action" entry at Initiative 20 with a used/unused checkbox that resets each round

Encounter Management:

Save/load encounters — save your current combat setup from the Encounters tab, including creature quantities and lair action settings; load them back with one tap
Quick-add multiples — quantity field in the Add Creature modal lets you add "5 Skeletons" at once with auto-numbering
Combat log — auto-records turns, damage, healing, conditions, effects, and more; viewable in the Log tab or in a side panel in landscape mode

Visual/UX:

Color-coded rows — PCs are blue-tinted, allies green, enemies red for instant visual scanning
Landscape layout — on wider screens (iPad landscape), the combat log appears in a side panel next to the creature list
Four tabs — Combat, Roster, Encounters, and Log
